InputClear class for MooTools 1.2
Version 1.0
Author: Ian Collins (3n)



InputClear is a class for MooTools v1.2 that adds a close button (x) to the
end of INPUT tags (like on the iPhone and Safari 3). 

Call it like this:
  new InputClear(input_element[, options])
  
Options/Defaults:
  input_zindex			: 10,
	button_zindex			: 20, 
	font_family				: 'Helvetica', 
	border_radius			: 5,
	background_color 	: '#ccc',
	color							: 'white', 
	spacing						: 3,
	auto_hide					: true
	
	Those should all be obvious except auto_hide. The auto_hide option, when left
	true, will automatically hide the (x) when it isn't needed.
  	
InvisibleDimensions 
  This is another class I wrote that allows you to get the 
  dimensions of an element that isn't visible, displayed or in the DOM. 
  If you include it in your JS then InputClear will use it, meaning your input
  tag doesn't need to be displayed on page load for InputClear to work.

You only need the classes displayed in the Class' dependencies (and all
classes required by them).
